# Info

 - *What is Hovertank 3D?*

*Hovertank 3D* is a vehicular combat game placing you in the shoes of Brick Sledge, a mercenary for hire.

It was one of the first faux-3D games to be released, this one being released under Softdisk back in April 1991.

The engine used in Hovertank 3D would later be used for the Wolfenstein 3D games as well and serve as inspiration for the original DOOM engine (or officially known as the idTech 1 engine)

- *Why do a clone of Hovertank 3D?*

I wanted to quickly get back into learning Unity3D again after having not used it for the past few years.

The game logic in Hovertank 3D isn't overly complex either, so I knew it would be excellent practice.

 - *Can I use this code for X or Y?*
 
I mean for the dozen or so people that'll read this, go right ahead.

I did this primarily for future employment purposes, so I won't really lose sleep if someone decides to clone this git and use the code for whatever they wish.
